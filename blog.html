        <p><strong>map()</strong> <br>
            map() is used to transform an array by applying a function to each element in the array and returning a new array with the results. The returned array will have the same length as the input array and it does not change the original array.

        </p><br>
        <p><strong>forEach()</strong> <br>
            forEach() is a  callback function which is  execute for each element in the array and it does not return anything.

        </p><br>
        <p><strong>filter()</strong> <br>
            filter() is used to create a new array from a given array by filtering out elements that do not meet a certain criteria specified by a function. The returned array may have a different length than the input array.

        </p><br>
        <p><strong>find()</strong> <br>
            find() is used to return the first element in an array that meets a certain criteria specified by a function. If no element is found, it returns undefined.

        localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies are all mechanisms that allow web applications to store and retrieve data on the client-side. However, they differ in terms of their features, capabilities, and limitations. <br><br>

        <strong>localStorage</strong> <br>
        Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.The stored data is not deleted when the browser is closed.It allows 10MB of data to be stored. <br><br>

        <strong>sessionStorage</strong> <br>
        Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications.The data is stored only for the session and will be deleted when the browser is closed.It allows 5MB of data to be stored. <br><br>

        <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
        Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for a long time, such as session IDs.The data can be set to expire at a certain time.The storage capacity is limited to 4KB of data.

        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">3. what is event loop and how does it work ? </h1><br>
        The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. <br><br>

        The event loop works by continuously checking the call stack and the task queue. The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the currently executing function. When a function is called, it is added to the call stack, and when it returns, it is removed from the stack.
